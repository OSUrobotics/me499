# What are lists?
#
# Lists are just ordered collections of anything. They mutable - the can be edited "in place".
#  Although lists can be treated as arrays (see numpy array) in fact they are a lot more flexible. Arrays
#   require that all the element types be the same, and if the array is n-dimensional (think matrix) then all the
#   rows have to have the same number of elements. This is NOT true for lists.
# Lists are primarily used to keep data that may be changing over time or of different types. Some common examples:
#  Keep the header/row names of the columns/rows of a spreadsheet
#  Keep the n parameter values you want to try in a function (think spring constant, joint angles, etc)
# In general, if you want to do something n times with n different values, put those values in a list and then
#  iterate over the list with a for loop
#
# The primary "gotcha" of lists is that variable names are pointers - assigning a = b does NOT copy the values of b into
#  a, a points to the exact same data as b did. So editing b will edit a and vice versa.
#
# There are many utilities/functions for iterating over, sorting and building lists.
# Related data structures:
#   strings - a list of characters, immutable
#   tuples - a list of anything (like a list), but immutable (you can't change it once it's built)
#   numpy arrays - n-dimensional arrays of numbers or booleans. Provides very, very fast interation/operations over
#     those arrays
#
# Use strings or tuples if you just build the list and don't edit it/change it
# Use numpy arrays if all your data is of the same type (number, boolean)

# Creating lists
#   In general, [] is used to create a list AND access elements of it

# Use case: You know in advance what you want in the list (eg, parameters you want to try)
my_list_advance = ["A string", ["Another", "list", 3], 10.3, True]
print(my_list_advance)

# Use case: You are iterating over something and want to add the items in one at a time
#   Note that the for loop could be a lot more complicated, and include if statements
my_list_add = []  # Empty list
for i in range(0, 5):
    # Add in the string "item n"
    my_list_add.append("item " + str(i))
# Add in a "done", just for fun
my_list_add.append("done")
print(my_list_add)

# Fancy version, if you want to build the list in one line - requires being able to iterate over something
#   See list comprehension (that's the fancy name for this)
#  Iterates over the for loop, and puts the stuff on the left in the list
#    Identical to the above for loop, just in one line
my_list_fancy_add = ["item " + str(i) for i in range(0, 5)]
print(my_list_fancy_add)

# OPTIONAL - you can even do if statements
#  - in this case, if i is even, add the item
my_list_fancy_add_with_if = ["item " + str(i) for i in range(0, 5) if i % 2 == 0]
print(my_list_fancy_add_with_if)

# END OPTIONAL

# --------------------------------------------------
# Accessing elements of a list
#  - range is a generator function. To make it a list, we explicitly cast to a list
#    Could also use the [i for i in range(0,10)] syntax above
my_list_numbers = list(range(0, 10))
print(my_list_numbers)
print(f"First index: {my_list_numbers[0]}")   # Get one element out - note, index from 0
print(f"Last index: {my_list_numbers[-1]}")    # Get last element out - note -1
print(f"Slice index: {my_list_numbers[1:3]}")  # Get second, third - note does NOT include list[3]

# Looping over elements in the list
print("Starting loop")
for item in my_list_numbers:   # item will be each element in my_list_numbers in turn
    print(f"Item {item}")
print("Ending loop")

# Looping over some of the elements in the list (using slicing)
print("Starting loop")
for item in my_list_numbers[1:-1]:   # All but the first and last elements
    print(f"Item {item}")
print("Ending loop")

# Creating a new list from the old one
my_list_from_old = []
for item in my_list_numbers:
    # Create the element ["item n", n] (which is a list) and add it to the new list
    my_list_from_old.append([f"Item {item}", item])
print(my_list_from_old)

# OPTIONAL
# The following is a fairly complicated example that combines a for loop with an if statement and enumerate to
#   combine indexing with element access. There are two versions here; one that does this all in one line, the second
#   takes that single line apart and shows what it would look like in more traditional coding.

# You can return tuples from for loop iteration on lists to do indexing and values at the same time
#  - in this case, if i is even, add the item
my_list_fancy_add_with_if_and_enumerate = ["item " + str(i) + " is " + str(n) for i, n in enumerate(range(0, 5)) if i % 2 == 0]
print(my_list_fancy_add_with_if_and_enumerate)

# Taking this apart - this is the same code, just written in pieces
my_list_add_with_if_and_enumerate = []
# Build up to enumerate/range - you can print/look at each of these in the debugger
r = range(0, 5)  # Note: range is a generator function - not a list. It functions like a list, but doesn't actually make all the values
index_plus_r = enumerate(r)  # Enumerate is a generator as well
index_plus_r_as_list = list(index_plus_r)  # You can, however, cast to a list to see what it looks like
# index_plus_r[0] - this does NOT work, because index_plus_r is a generator, not a list
tuple_return = index_plus_r_as_list[0]  # See what one element looks like - see tuples tutorials
my_list_add_with_if_and_enumerate = []
for i, n in enumerate(range(0, 5)):
    i_str = str(i)
    n_str = str(n)
    make_str = "item " + i_str + " is " + n_str
    if i % 2 == 0:
        my_list_add_with_if_and_enumerate.append(make_str)

# Getting indices of elements
# Task: Suppose you have three lists, one with strings for what you want to do, and two with numbers. You want to do
#   something different depending on what is in the first list - eg, add instead of multiply. The output is a list
#   with the results (but only if the first list says to).

#  Here are multiple ways to do this, getting steadily more sophisticated.

# Old-school, matlab or C++ version
#  Declare an index variable and use the length of the list to iterate over
#   range produces the numbers 0, 1, etc through n-1
#   for the c programmer, there is no for (i = 0, i < n, i++) equivalent
my_list_result = []

# Better: Use python's enumerate function to get i (enumerate is AWESOME)
