""" This script illustrates the following concepts:
      Caching - how to save calculations in a variable to speed up computation
      Timing comparisons - how to use time() to figure out how long
          a computation took
      Try-except to catch parameter errors and to determine if
          the caching variables exist
      Associating attributes (variables) with functions
         - using default function attributes, like __name__
    Four versions: Caching y/n and instrumented for timing y/n

    Note: If you were to do this "cleanly" you would put all this in a
          class.
